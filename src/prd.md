## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, regulatory authority, strategic sophistication
**Design Personality**: Serious, trustworthy, enterprise-grade - befitting a tool for regulated industries
**Visual Metaphors**: Medical/scientific precision, regulatory frameworks, strategic planning
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with comprehensive information presentation balanced with clear navigation

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional blue-based palette with accent colors for risk and success
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.41 0.15 250)) - conveys trust, authority, and regulatory compliance
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue-gray for de-emphasized content
**Accent Color**: Orange (oklch(0.68 0.18 50)) for action items and critical information
**Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust essential for regulatory compliance tools; orange creates urgency for action items
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Primary blue on light background (4.8:1 contrast ratio)
- Dark gray on white for body text (13.5:1 contrast ratio)
- Orange accent on white for highlights (4.2:1 contrast ratio)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- H1: 2rem, bold, primary color for main sections
- H2: 1.5rem, semibold for subsections
- Body: 0.875rem, regular, dark gray
- Labels: 0.75rem, medium, muted for form elements
**Font Personality**: Clean, professional, highly legible - appropriate for technical documentation
**Which fonts**: Inter - excellent for technical interfaces with superior legibility at small sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Tab-based navigation guides users through logical assessment flow
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between sections to reduce cognitive load
**Grid System**: Responsive grid adapts from single column on mobile to multi-column layouts on desktop
**Content Density**: Balanced approach - comprehensive information without overwhelming interface

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for grouping related information and creating visual hierarchy
- Tabs for sequential workflow progression
- Progress bars for completion tracking
- Badges for status indication and categorization
- Alerts for critical information and warnings
**Component Customization**: shadcn components with consistent color theming
**Spacing System**: Tailwind spacing scale (4px base unit) for consistent rhythm

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
**Color Usage**: Never rely solely on color - always paired with text or icons
**Interactive Elements**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Architecture
**Persistence Strategy**: 
- useKV hooks for assessment data, organization info, and risk assessments
- State persists across browser sessions for incomplete assessments
- Export capability for external analysis and documentation

### Validation & Error Handling
**Assessment Validation**: Progress tracking prevents premature roadmap generation
**Data Validation**: Type checking and range validation for numerical inputs
**Error States**: Graceful handling of missing data with clear user guidance

### Scalability Needs
**Content Updates**: Risk factors and compliance mappings may need regular updates as regulations evolve
**Assessment Evolution**: Framework designed to accommodate additional assessment dimensions
**Multi-Regulatory**: Structure allows extension to EU MDR, ISO 13485, and other regulatory frameworks
